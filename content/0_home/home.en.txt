Content-builder: [{"content":{"text_block_content":"***Nocturnalities: Bargaining Beyond Rest*** is an ongoing artistic research project, an umbrella initiative that houses an archive, a book, a variety of artistic expression and public events and a platform that dives into exploration of the politics of sleep. It particularly aims to contextualise rest, exhaustion, anxiety and precarity in cultural labour, knowledge production and intimate strategies of care in the art world. Originally inspired by Jonathan Crary’s book *24/7: Late Capitalism and the Ends of Sleep* (2013) and Yann Moulier Boutang’s *Cognitive Capitalism* (2004), the project explores the intersection between cultural production, cognitive capitalism, politics of sleep and its psycho-cultural implications. It looks at sleep and consequently, rest through the performative forms of work—highlighting their communal impact and temporal boundaries. By initiating *Nocturnalities* we bring the expertise of visual artists, thinkers, and curators and embrace the power of rest, self-care and regeneration."},"id":"a94c2a16-0434-4e32-bfa1-10a698980896","isHidden":false,"type":"text_block"},{"content":{"button_block_string":"Subscribe","button_block_popup":"true","button_linktype":"linkurl","button_linkurl_target":"http://eepurl.com/iCr1co","button_linkemail_target":"","button_linkpage_target":[],"button_linkfilepage_target":[],"button_linkfilesite_target":[]},"id":"b492ca07-bf4e-4451-b6d5-d27ab72ae7ff","isHidden":false,"type":"button_block"},{"content":{"button_block_string":"Instagram","button_block_popup":"true","button_linktype":"linkurl","button_linkurl_target":"https://www.instagram.com/nocturnalities.rest/","button_linkemail_target":"","button_linkpage_target":[],"button_linkfilepage_target":[],"button_linkfilesite_target":[]},"id":"db71b7dc-34a1-4db3-8a88-5897fd2eed3b","isHidden":false,"type":"button_block"},{"content":{"text_block_content":"## Open call\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

The project has been developed by Amsterdam-based artist and researcher Andrea Knezović in collaboration with editor and publisher Agata Bar and Fanfare Design Studio It investigates the intersection between cultural production, cognitive capitalism, the politics of rest and its psycho-cultural implication within the Dutch cultural and artistic landscape. How do we assume rest in the arts? Can art institutions take a sabbatical? How do they deal with the necessity of the rest of their often freelance workers? The aim of the project is to bring together a discursive and creative dialogue between artists, institutions and art practitioners by creating a publication and an online archive that is a visual trance witnessing different voices regarding the topic within the local artistic ecologies. The project tackles the nature and rhythm of the current mentality of the artistic scene—reflecting the zeitgeist of this age's socioeconomic and bio-political mechanism. Its initial intent is to unify the scattered voices of the art field and reach out in a dialogue that will ripple through different institutional and individual channels. \n\nWe believe that through this project we will establish an artistic dialogue that will reflect the concerns of marginalized communities such as migrants, neurodiverse individuals, queer communities, those struggling with mental health and single parents working within the cultural sector. We strongly believe that the development of this project, its discursive capacity and communal value are of crucial importance to the local cultural landscape. It is essential that through creative dialogue, innovative labour and exercises of rest we find alliances that can deliver progressive attitudes for the future to come. This is not just a creative articulation, but rather a mentality and belief in better frameworks of cultural performance, support and encouragement of the founding bodies towards the cause, and finally relentless persistence of the community to strive for better conditions."},"id":"2a55d6c3-a8f3-4158-9075-385a8783232f","isHidden":false,"type":"text_block"},{"content":{"text_block_content":"## About\n\n(link: https://andreaknezovic.com text: Andrea Knezović) is a conceptual visual artist and researcher with an MRes in Artistic Research from the University of Amsterdam and a BA from the Academy of Visual Arts Ljubljana.
